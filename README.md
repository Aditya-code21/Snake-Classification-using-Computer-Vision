# Snake-Classification-using-Computer-Vision
A deep learning project to classify snake breeds using the ResNet50 model in a Kaggle Notebook. Trained on the "Identifying Different Breeds of Snakes" dataset from Kaggle, the notebook includes preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation for accurate image-based snake species classification.
